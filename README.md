# Dotfiles

Just a repo for storing dotfiles and any other 'important' software configurations I use.

## [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

I use neovim because I honestly just prefer having the floating window feature, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction which the software is going. There are some pretty obvious flaws in my plugin configuration, but I generally don't use most of those plugins - I'm mostly just trying them out.

## [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)

Skhd is an awesome, highly configuration hotkey daemon which allows me to map key strokes to shell commands. I use mine in conjunction with my tiling wm [yabai (successor to chunkwm and kwm)](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)

## [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)

I love tiling window managers (particularly those which support gaps). They generally improve my productivity, and they make my experience using a computer more pleasurable.
